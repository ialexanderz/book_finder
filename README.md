## **API**
This app will implement Google's free books api to search for books and obtain information on a given book such as its title, author, and cover image.

This app will only be using publicly available data and thus will not need a Google Books API key. You can learn more about the api documentation at [Google Books API Documentation Overview](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/overview)
